# Standalone nodewatcher

## Description

This repository contains the nodewatcher and all it's distributed subscripts from the [Freifunk Franken Firmware](https://github.com/FreifunkFranken/firmware).
It has been slightly modified to allow easy operation on custom built routers.

I will try to keep this version in sync with future changes to the upstream version of the scripts.
The version number for the nodewatcher in this repository is constructed by `upstream version` + `'-sa'` + `patch version (if applicable)`, so for example `59-sa1`


## Usage

Clone this repository, adjust the variables in `settings.sh` and run `./nodewatcher`
